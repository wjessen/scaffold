I want an idea for an application that can be written in many different programming languages and a way to learn that new language.  It will need to include a series of basic commands to illistrate some of the syntax of the lanuage.  It will also need to have something that is a core competency or use case of the language.

### Basics
* Assigning Variables
* Creating Variables
* * Different data types:
* * * string
* * * int
* * * char
* * * list (vector etc)
* defining functions
* * Function must take arguments
* importing a function from another file
* importing a function from another directory
* importing a function from another library
* importing a class from another file
* importing a class from another dir
* importing a class from another library
* writing a for loop
* writing a main loop
* handle an error
* print to stdout
* accept argument from stdin
* make a web request
* parse something from a file
* connect to database
* read from database
* call an API


### Specific:
* Figure out what a core competency of this language is and implement a simple version into the application

# Language Ideas:
* go
* c++
* c
* LISP
* perl
* rust
* java
* Haskell
