I want an idea for an application that can be written in many different programming languages and a way to learn that new language.  It will need to include a series of basic commands to illistrate some of the syntax of the lanuage.  It will also need to have something that is a core competency or use case of the language.

### Basics
* Assigning Variables
* Creating Variables
  * Different Data Types:
    * String
    * Int
    * Char
    * List (& Other collections)
* Defining Functions
  *  Function Must Take Arguments
* Importing A Class/Function From Another File/Dir/Library
* Importing A Class/Function From Another File/Dir/Library
* Writing A For Loop
* Writing a While Loop
* Writing A Main Loop
* Handle An Error
* Print To Stdout
* Accept Argument From Stdin
* Make A Web Request
* Parse Something From A File
* Connect To Database
* Read From Database
* Call An Api
* Running Test

### Platform:
* Creating Project Structure
* Create a package/publish witht his code
* Create Docker image
* Create K8s Deployment

### Specific:
* Figure out what a core competency of this language is and implement a simple version into the application

## Language Ideas:
* go
* c++
* c
* LISP
* perl
* rust
* java
* Haskell
